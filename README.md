🎟️ Real-Time Event Ticketing System  

🚀 Overview  
The Real-Time Event Ticketing System is a next-gen platform designed to revolutionize how tickets are managed for live events. Whether you're a vendor releasing tickets or a customer frantically trying to grab the last seat, this system ensures smooth, synchronized, and real-time operations. Powered by cutting-edge multi-threading (Producer-Consumer pattern) and robust backend APIs, it simulates real-world ticketing scenarios. Perfect for students, developers, or anyone ready to embrace the chaos of ticketing management.  

🔧 Features  
- Concurrency Handling: Multiple vendors and customers operating simultaneously without skipping a beat.  
- Real-Time Updates: Live dashboard showcasing ticket availability and transaction status.  
- Robust Backend: Built with Node.js, ensuring high-speed, scalable ticket processing.  
- Thread-Safe Operations: Eliminate race conditions and deadlocks with advanced synchronization.  
- Flexible Tech Stack: React.js for the frontend, MongoDB or MySQL for data persistence.  
- Logging & Error Handling: Comprehensive logs to monitor every ticket added, purchased, or error encountered.  

💻 Usage Instructions  
🔹 Frontend

📊 Key Concepts  
1. Producer-Consumer Pattern**:  
   - Vendors act as producers, adding tickets to the pool.  
   - Customers are consumers, retrieving tickets from the pool.  

2. Multi-Threading:  
   - Simulate real-world concurrency with multiple threads operating in harmony.  

3. Synchronization:  
   - Ensure thread-safe operations with synchronized methods.
